# Release notes

## Unreleased — MVP candidate

### Known limitations

- When a gateway instance is declared lost, a surviving instance finalizes its
  unfinished jobs. Pending tasks become `skipped`; running tasks become `failed`
  with reason `GATEWAY_INSTANCE_LOST`. Batches that have not been dispatched are
  not automatically resumed by another gateway instance.
- Cross-instance continuation of undispatched batches is on the
  [Roadmap](docs/design.md#17-roadmap).

This describes an accepted MVP limitation. It does not indicate that an MVP
release has been published.
